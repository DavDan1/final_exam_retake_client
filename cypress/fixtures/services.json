The company’s ambition is to reach an audience that fully reflects the diversity of London.\nOpera on Film will make films of our productions freely available to hospitals, care homes, hospices, shelters and schools in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and the City of Westminster, in a variety of formats.\nLast year, we launched with the acclaimed 2019 production of Verdi’s Un ballo in maschera, directed by Rodula Gatainou and conducted by Matthew Kofi Waldren, Opera on Film will be made available with subtitles to increase accessibility and understanding, and will be complemented by interviews with the creative teams.\nAs with OHP’s Schools’ Matinee performances of The Marriage of Figaro (2021) and Un ballo in maschera (2019), an education resource pack will be provided. Support will also be provided for care homes, hospices, shelters and hospitals from OHP’s Inspire team and the OHP Young Artists.\nOHP has been addressing social exclusion since 2005. With Opera on Film, the company will be able to include those who are unable to attend the theatre among the members of its audience. This vital community initiative is launched in partnership with the company’s resident orchestra, City of London Sinfonia.\nOpera on Film will be available from summer 2021.\nContact Inspire on inspire@operahollandpark.com if you would like to order Opera on Film for your hospital, care home, hospice, shelter or school.\n",
